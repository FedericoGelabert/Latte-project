Bad times, Good Coffee â˜•


## Story
In the aftermath of a financial crisis, a couple, Mia and Alex, decided to turn their passion for coffee into a business. Despite the challenges, they opened 'Latte'. Their slogan, 'Bad times, good coffee.', embodied their belief that amidst adversity, a comforting cup of coffee could bring solace and hope. Today, Latte stands as a symbol of resilience, serving not just coffee but a reminder that even in tough times, there's always comfort in a warm brew.
